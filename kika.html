        <h3>The bouba/kiki effect is a non-arbitrary mapping between speech sounds and the visual shape of objects. This effect was first observed by German-American psychologist Wolfgang K\u00f6hler in 1929.[1] In psychological experiments first conducted on the island of Tenerife (where the primary language is Spanish), K\u00f6hler showed forms similar to those shown at the right and asked participants which shape was called "takete" and which was called "baluba" ("maluma" in the 1947 version).</h3>
